<h2 id="orgb3845f4">Josettan's house: Migrant labour in Kerala</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb3845f4">
<p>
There's a new ad on Kerala's cable networks. It features a colourful, caricatured, bunch of foreigners visiting a small-town home. The gang includes a 'Maasai' tribesman in full traditional get-up, a hat-wearing 'English' lady in a sky-blue [\(frock\)], a kimono-wearing 'Japanese', a 'Chinese' peasant in straw hat and a long dress, a 'Scot' man-spreading in his kilt, a 'Mexican' wearing a sombrero strumming a guitar.

<p>
This rag-tag group of fancy-dress costumes is in Kerala, Thrissur to be precise, to see Josettan's house. Josettan has coated his house with the advertiser's pain, protecting it from Kerala's notoriously humid weather. Josettan, being the generous Syrian Christian Thrissur-ite that he is, has agreed to share lessons in painting his house to this assorted group of fancy dress competitors. 
</p>

<p>
The ad is striking in its attention to detail [$Pending. Fill this in.$]

<h3 id="org590cbf9">Africans in Kerala's popular culture</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org590cbf9">
<p>
Africans characters don't make prominent appearances in Malayalam movies or ads. The last major movie was 'Sudani from Nigeria'&#x2013; the story of a young African footballer who comes to Malabar to play in the local 7 a-side football tournament. No other detailed portraits of African characters come to mind. 
</p>

<p>
And yet, here's a mere advertisement, detailed enough to get the specific African tribe's name correct, and to translate the news about the protagonist's house in Swahili. 'Nyumba ya Josettan' is the title of a photo essay in the 'Maasai Times' newspaper which brought the Maasai tribesman to Thrissur in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Curiously, Americans seem to be absent from the assorted group of national costumes. [\(I wonder why\)]

<h3 id="org6ef7968">Portrayal of Bengali migrant labourer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6ef7968">
<p>
The portrayal of the Bengali migrant in the ad is also notable. Our Maasai visitor, after reaching a major intersection in Thrissur town asks a Bengali migrant labourer for directions to Josettan's house. The migrant worker replies in a thickly accented Malayalam, 'Avide <span class="underline">Setta</span>', a corruption of 'Avide Chetta'. Chetta the male honorific in Malayalam gets mangled into the 'Setta' of Bengali. The Bengali labour also has a <b>Bengali</b> newspaper in his hand, another nice touch of detail. I'm not aware of any Bengali newspapers circulating in Thrissur, but if they indeed do, that would be an indication of how deeply rooted out-of-state migrant labourers have become.

<h4 id="orgdcc3f83">Migrant labourers in Kerala and rest of South India.</h4>

<p>
[\(Put this in context. How many migrants in Kerala, Karnataka, etc? How important is this trend?\)]
  The reception of Hindi/ Odiya/ Bhojpuri speaking migrant labour in Kerala, has been drastically different from other South Indian states. Kerala, both the government as well as private citizens, have been generously accommodative. For instance, buses of major migrant hubs write their routes in Hindi as well as Malayalam. Children of migrant labourers regularly make the news during examinations for scoring well, including in Malayalam. [\(News articles on Perumbavoor-- movies, buses and shop signs\)] 
</p>

<p>
[\(Note on Awas insurance scheme launched by the government\)] 
</p>

<p>
Now compare this to the anti-Hindi agitations of Bangalore and Chennai.
This is radically at odds with the reception they have received in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, for instance. The anti-Hindi agitation in Tamil Nadu is well known. Even in Bangalore, there are few signs in Hindi accommodating the large migrant base which speaks neither English nor Kannada. Most of the Karnataka Sarige buses have their boards in Kannada alone, with the fancier buses having an electronic ticker for English displays. [$Protests against Hindi language in Bangalore metro,$]
</p>

<p>
What explains this difference? What makes Hindi on a signboard verbotten for Kannadigas, while a flesh-and-blood Bengali migrant in an ad aimed at true-blue Malayali home-owners is virtually unnoticed?
</p>

<p>
Could it be that generations of emigration to the Gulf has made Malayalis particularly sensitive to the pain and trials of migration, and are more empathetic in the social contract they offer out-of-state migrants? Or is it because the migration into Kerala so far has been of menial labourers who don't put down deep roots, and hence don't challenge or threaten the social and political dominance of the natives?
